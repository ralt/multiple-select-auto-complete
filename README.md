multiple-select-auto-complete
===

Purpose
---

Transforms a multiple select into an input auto complete. Doesn't alter the form
behavior at all.

Multiple select elements are especially hard when there are a lot of items in it,
this plugin is there to enhance the user experience.

Will be a jQuery plugin.
